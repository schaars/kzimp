=== PaxosInside ===

Nodes are colocated.
You can vary the size of the messages.
All communication mechanisms implemented: TCP, UDP, Unix, Pipe, IPC MQ, POSIX MQ, Barrelfish MP, ULM

A client sends a request to the leader (node 0)
The leader sends an accept_req to the acceptor (node 1)
The acceptor sends a learn to all the learners 
Node 0, when receiving a learn message, sends a response to the client.
