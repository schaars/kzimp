=== PaxosInside ===

Nodes are not colocated, i.e. if you want 1 client, 1 leader, 1 acceptor and 3 learners then you need 6 cores.
You can vary the size of the messages.
We have implemented ULM and Barrelfish MP.

A client sends a request to the leader (node 0)
The leader sends an accept_req to the acceptor (node 1)
The acceptor sends a learn to all the learners (nodes > 1)
When a learner receives a learn message, it sends a response to the client.
The client waits for 1 response before issuing the next request.
