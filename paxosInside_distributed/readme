== PaxosInside ===

Nodes are not colocated, i.e. if you want 1 client, 1 leader, 1 acceptor and 3 learners then you need 6 cores.
You can vary the size of the messages.
We have implemented ULM and Barrelfish MP.

The system is in an open loop.
There are 2 clients: client <nb_paxos_nodes> receives requests.
Client <nb_paxos_nodes+1> sends requests (infinite loop).
A client sends a request to the leader (node 0)
The receiving client computes the throughput over N reiceived proposals.

The leader sends an accept_req to the acceptor (node 1)
The acceptor sends a learn to all the learners (nodes > 1)
When a learner receives a learn message, it sends a response to the receiving client.
The receiving client waits for 1 response before considering receiving the next proposal.
